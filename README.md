### **Anne's Progress**

**Currently finished**: general layout/styling of the website (minus header and footer), placeholder space for the dropdown menu (minus functional menu options), and placeholder formatting for tips and tip categories when results populate.

**To-do**: prevent multiple clicks for like/dislike buttons from registering by the user (ignoring page refreshes).
