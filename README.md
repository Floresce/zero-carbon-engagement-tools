### **Anne's Progress**

**Currently finished on 11/18**: general layout/styling of the website (minus header and footer), initial look of the dropdown menu (minus functional menu options), and intial formatting for tips and tip categories when results populate.

**To-do**: record user feedback for tips (likes/dislikes) into DB and prevent multiple clicks from registering by the user (ignoring page refreshes).
